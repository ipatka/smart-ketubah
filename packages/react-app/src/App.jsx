## Metadata

### The Date and Place of the Wedding

On this Tuesday, the 6th day of the month September in the year 2022 of the Gregorian calendar, 19 Fructidor An CCXXX in the French Republican calendar, 10 Elul 5782 in the Hebrew calendar; in the year of the Tiger;

Here in the city of Sol√©rieux in the French Republic and in the great region of Provence; 

### The Groom, the Bride and the Proposal

Benjamin, son of Andrew and Kelly of the family Moskowitz, said to this daughter of the Fran√ßois-Rastoin family Camille: "Be thou my wife according to the laws of France, the United States and the rules that together we will craft for our union."

Camille, daughter of Natalie Rastoin and Edouard Fran√ßois, future matriarch of the Tronix dynasty, said to Ben: "Be thou my husband according to the laws of France, the United States and the rules that together we will craft for our union."

## Framework

### Our shared mission and beliefs

We commit to continue our shared journey of lovingkindness and good works.

Human beings are younger longer than any other creature on earth. When we are young, we learn, we socialize, we play, we experiment, we are curious, we feel wonder, we feel joy, we change, we grow, we constantly create, we hope. We have the freedom to imagine and make the world.

These traits are alive in us, and will continue to enliven our union in the years to come, as we grow, age, face hurdles, harden, loosen up, and journey together towards the sunset. 

We will never stop playing and learning. We commit to live in this way not just for our own happiness, but because we wish for happiness and growth for all. 

We practice tikkun olam. Tikkun means to repair or improve. Olam means the entire world. Ben was taught that any activity that improves the world, brings it closer to the harmonious state for which it was created. Tikkun Olam implies that while the world is innately good, there is always room for us to improve it.

We recognize our blessings and pledge to be guided by wisdom and compassion, not least in times of abundance but also when times are lean, seas are stormy, and the light of reason fails to shine through. We understand that the arc of the moral universe bends towards progress only when people bend.

We carry forward the legacy of those who preceded us:

The legacy of Lenore and Benjamin Levinson who in lean times opened a pension to feed, house and care for their community.

The legacy of Gilbert Rastoin‚ÄîMayor of Cassis, civic and political leader, and environmentalist‚Äîwho led the initiative to secure the calanques de Cassis for future generations, and who taught Camille civic duty and the importance of a good joke.

May their generosity and spirit of sharing guide us in the years ahead.

### Our journey so far

In our decade together, we built a strong love based on mutual respect; overcame borders and burdens; thrived on three continents.

We came together around shared values of libert√©, √©galit√©, and openness. We geologically formed a mountain together, rising effortlessly yet deliberately, time passing quickly but companionship timeless.

### Our principles

We pledge to tenderly nurture each other, to grow independently and together as we continue to explore the world.

We pledge to enable each other‚Äôs dreams. We pledge to always broaden our horizons.

Our union is lasting.

Our union is kindness.

Our union is curiosity.

Our union is openness

Our union is reciprocal.

Our union is generational.

Our union is aspirational. 

Our union is always changing.

Our union is more than the sum of our parts.

### Our rules

Nothing is more important to us than love. We focus our attention on things that will matter when we know we will look back upon them. 

We protect our energy, taking pride in our good works but putting these works in perspective. We remember to breathe and enjoy the ride.

We will bring patience in recognition of the many thoughts vying for prominence. We pledge to be fair and discursive in our approach.

There is no aspiration too great for us, no dream too early or late.

### Our seasons

We will escape the cold in winter.

We will seek the sun in summer. 

With the coming of every new year, we will take note of the things we aspire to do together. 

With the passing of every five years, we will hold a grand celebration and assess our future plans. 

We will celebrate Thanksgiving in California and Christmas in France.

Because Ben and Camille were legally wedded on September 3rd, the day of Ben‚Äôs birthday, and because September 6th is still too close to Ben‚Äôs birthday, we will celebrate our wedding anniversary every year during the March equinox, which marks the beginning of astronomical Spring in the Northern Hemisphere. This is to ensure the family calendar provides year-round opportunities for celebration.

### Our community

And we will turn to our friends, family and community for support and wise counsel. 

## Signing

### The Bride Accepted the Proposal

Having affirmed the principles of the union, Camille consented and became Benjamin‚Äôs wife,

Having affirmed the principles of the union, Benjamin consented and became Camille‚Äôs husband.

### Exchange

Marking the occasion of the union, we exchanged nail-shaped rings, symbolizing the continuous work of building a home, a life, a family.

### Then Everything Was Sealed

And the Tronix dynasty was born.

All that is stated and explained above is by joint consent, and was recorded September 3rd in Paris in an instrument legally fit to establish a formal marriage bond in the eyes of the law. 

The marriage being valid and established, this document serves as a continuous record of the union of Camille and Benjamin and the journey of the Tronix dynasty.
